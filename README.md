# transcend
Imagine an open-source oscar-winning production...

The box office, triple platinum, and masterpiece of the future will be built by an open source hive mind. It will be bidirectional, iterative, generative, evolutionary and transcendent.

Great products are built by teams of dedicated people when multiple engineers find that hyper-generative frequency. Great artistic productions are no different.

Engineering = Art

Github = Art Version Control
