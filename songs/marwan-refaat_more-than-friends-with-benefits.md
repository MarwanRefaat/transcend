## Lyrics

Started as friends but now that’s in the past

We shifted gears and we’re moving fast



I don’t quite know how or when when we crossed the line

But I just can't seem to get you off my mind

And we could keep being friends or you could start being mine



Cause it's not like I woke up one day and just flipped a switch

But I knew there was no going back when we kissed

So what if we could be more than just friends with benefits



Jeapordize our friendship it’s all we know

But what happen we come the other though


I don’t quite remember it’s not switch I fell love and but I still remember the feeling then we kissed

I don’t quite know how or when when we crossed the line

But I can’t stop thinking about a world where you’re miners 


We’ve tried being friend and now you should try being mind


I get how you’re feeling your on the fence

And One side is our friendship could end

But tell me what do you on the other side

Cause if you feel how I feel how long do you plan to hide


Maybe we could more than just than just friends benefits 


Now I’m thinking could it be more than this

Maybe we could be more than friends with benefits
