# **GUIDE:**

üí° The contents below are not a part of the song above but rather exist as a guide outlining the general standards of a top 10 hit song.

These are ‚Äúsoft‚Äù constraints to guide creativity but virtually no top 10 song meets all of these entirely, data *can‚Äôt* replace creativity but maybe it can guide it.

# **SCRATCHPAD:**

I can‚Äôt hear you it‚Äôs way to loud

I can‚Äôt hear you over all this sound
But your the finest girl I‚Äôve seen around

I can‚Äôt hear you over these decibels
But I‚Äôm into you and can‚Äôt you tell
So if I move my lips just nod say yes
Move your body closer before I second guess

Didn‚Äôt a word you said but your eyes spoke loud
If I can read your lips is kissing them allowed
I‚Äôm fluent in body language your mother tongue dance
And the way your body moving I can‚Äôt misunderstand

We might not need English but we might need math
I need 10 digits from you on my number pad
Y = Mx + B now I have your line
I can open up my phone don‚Äôt need no words for that
I just need 10 digits from you so do the math
When I text you it‚Äôll all add up
I‚Äôll hit send like an equals sign cause I want some
If I text you an equals sign it means I want some

You don‚Äôt need words if you do the math
Open parenthesis and put three digits in
Then close brackets up add three more
And if you see a dash then add four more

Cause you know I want sum and you‚Äôre looking like an equals sign
