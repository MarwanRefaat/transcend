# **GUIDE:**

üí° The contents below are not a part of the song above but rather exist as a guide outlining the general standards of a top 10 hit song.

These are ‚Äúsoft‚Äù constraints to guide creativity but virtually no top 10 song meets all of these entirely, data *can‚Äôt* replace creativity but maybe it can guide it.

# LYRICS:

**Girl I seen u around**

I know u get down

I‚Äôll take u to the pound

Cat girl ur mine yeah u got found

Cat girl

Live in your own world

Cat girl

U better not get lost

Cat girl

U better not get lost

Or you‚Äôll get caught

And u might get hurt

Scratch to the face

Left a scar at least it‚Äôs me

My little lady she make sounds yeah that‚Äôs a dream

She might go wild make me bleed

Sometimes I feed her and I take her to a scene

Not much else she needs
