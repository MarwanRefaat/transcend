See itâ€™s getting pretty late

So tell me what you wanna do?

You could come back to my place

Well honestly itâ€™s just a room

You texted me said you were bored

Well I know just what we should do

Chorus

Iâ€™ll give you a tour of my room

All 80 square feet

So first things first this is the door

Yeah the lock works too

No bed frame mattress on the floor

And a brick wall view

Cause you see my room has a door

And the lock works too

Iâ€™ll give you a tour of my room

All 80 square feet

The main attraction is a pile of dirty clothes

And our attraction might make one with some sheets

Yeah I know I should clean my room

And do that pile of laundry on the right

But Iâ€™ll push it off to tomorrow

There will be more if you stay the night

A flag on the wall that says Saturdays are for the boys

Keep my mattress on the floor

Flag on the wall too that says

Saturdays for the boys

But Iâ€™ll make an exception for you

A pile of laundry on the floor

Stay the night and Iâ€™ll have some more

And with the mattress on the floor

So all the neighbors hear is you

I know I might get evicted if I get one more noise complaint

But California lawâ€™s on our side so youâ€™ve got a place to stay

You ask

Why there a bed in you living room

Cause my boy needs some living room

And why does your fridge smell like that?

Itâ€™s been three months since I first asked

Iâ€™lll give you a tour of my room

All 50 square feet

First things the mattress on the floor
