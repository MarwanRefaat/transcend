# **GUIDE:**

üí° The contents below are not a part of the song above but rather exist as a guide outlining the general standards of a top 10 hit song.

These are ‚Äúsoft‚Äù constraints to guide creativity but virtually no top 10 song meets all of these entirely, data *can‚Äôt* replace creativity but maybe it can guide it.

# LYRICS:

**Have I?**

Lost my sense of peace

Gone stuck in a dream

Days no longer breath

Choking on their speed

Farewell

to my needs

A hotel

Where my imagination sleeps

Through hell

Cuz if we bleed we‚Äôll get the green

Expelled

If I don‚Äôt want to live a fake routine

Oh How I wish I could go back

Back to before I was eighteen

Long nights

Drinking by the sea

Fictional delights

Cuz I‚Äôm distracted by the time

rewind

I miss that passive city life

Tonight

I work until my patience dies

Some instrumental

Oh How I wish I could go back

Back to before I was eighteen

More instrumental

Oh How I wish I could go back

Back to before I was eighteen
