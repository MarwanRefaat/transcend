üí° The contents below are not a part of the song above but rather exist as a guide outlining the general standards of a top 10 hit song.

These are ‚Äúsoft‚Äù constraints to guide creativity but virtually no top 10 song meets all of these entirely, data *can‚Äôt* replace creativity but maybe it can guide it.

# LYRICS:

VERSE

C G Am F

I was running through a field of daisies

Some people say that I‚Äôm crazy

But I got sunshine on my mind

You were standing on the other side maybe

I‚Äôm always keeping you waiting

But you know I‚Äôm not keeping time

BUILD

C G Am F

One foot in front of the other

Shoes untied but laces don‚Äôt bother

Sun beats down

And I‚Äôm going too fast

Heart rate up

Necklace unlatched

Eyes lock an arms length away now

Don‚Äôt go yet I want you to stay now

You and me

Under the clouds

Feel my heart

It‚Äôs beating out loud

CHORUS

C G Am F

Cause baby all around us are daisies

Heads are spinning so hazy

Wishing that time would stop

And I just can‚Äôt help it but to stare

Putting a flower in my hair

I‚Äôll race you to the top

And when we‚Äôre both together on that hill

Take it all in it‚Äôs a damn thrill

not finished lol
