# Kingdoms

Verse

Am Em F E

I remember when we were younger, we‚Äôd go walking through the streets

Am Em F E

Oh this place it feels so massive

Worlds of wonder at our feet

Am Em F E

Light a candle, close your eyes and, make a wish just give me your hand

Am Em F Am

Keep it inside, this is real life, hold your breath baby I‚Äôve got a plan

Em F E

Am Em F E

Chorus

Am Em F E

We will walk the walk don‚Äôt walk away

Count your blessings for now

Am Em F E

Say the things we‚Äôve always wanted to say

Make sure they are loud

Am Em F E

And the wishes we once made

Fuel the fire feel the flames

Am Em F Am

What was lost is finally found

Building kingdoms the ground

Em F E

Am Em F E

Verse

Am Em F E

Minutes turn to hours

Turn to days turn into years

Am Em F E

Fairytales turn into legends

As we face all of our fears

Am Em F E

Take a step and don‚Äôt look back and

Build the world you want to see

Am Em F Am

Climb that mountain look around and

This is where we were both meant to be

Am Em F E

Am Em F E

Chorus

Am Em F E

We will walk the walk don‚Äôt walk away

Count your blessings for now

Am Em F E

Say the things we‚Äôve always wanted to say

Make sure they are loud

Am Em F E

And the wishes we once made

Fuel the fire feel the flames

Am Em F Am

What was lost is finally found

Building kingdoms the ground

Bridge

Am Em F E

Have you ever held

A dream in your hands

Am Em F E

I‚Äôll share it with you now

Soon you‚Äôll understand

Am Em F E

The fires burning quick

Count backwards from ten

Am Em F Am

If it burns our kingdom down

We‚Äôll rebuild it once again

Chorus

Am Em F E

We will walk the walk don‚Äôt walk away

Count your blessings for now

Am Em F E

Say the things we‚Äôve always wanted to say

Make sure they are loud

Am Em F E

And the wishes we once made

Fuel the fire feel the flames

Am Em F Am

Our prints are so profound

Building kingdoms the ground
