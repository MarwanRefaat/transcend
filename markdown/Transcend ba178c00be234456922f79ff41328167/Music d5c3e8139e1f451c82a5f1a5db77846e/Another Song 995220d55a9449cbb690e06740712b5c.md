Verse

It‚Äôs just (C) another day

Another (E7) heartbreak

And I am (Dm) sitting here (Am)

Waiting for (Fmaj7) another reason to (G) stay

Writing (C) another song

Hoping that (E7) you might sing along

But I‚Äôm just (Dm) another girl (Am)

And you‚Äôve had (Fmaj7) another for so (F) long

Chorus

How could I be (C) so easily

(E7) fooled by you

When you‚Äôd say you (Dm) love me (Am)

Now I know you (Fmaj7) loved her too (G)

You got me (C) so blue and

Neither of (E7) us ever had a clue

You thought you could (Dm) play me (Am)

You though you could (Fmaj7) play her too (F)

Verse

This is (C) another song

About how (E7) you did me wrong

I‚Äôm writing in (Dm) misery (Am)

The last one I (Fmaj7) wrote when I was strong (G)

You‚Äôre picking (C) another fight

But no way in (E7) hell you‚Äôre in the right

I don‚Äôt wanna (Dm) hear it (Am)

I just want you (Fmaj7) out of my sight (F)

Chorus

How could I be (C) so easily

(E7) fooled by you

When you‚Äôd say you (Dm) love me (Am)

Now I know you (Fmaj7) loved her too (G)

You got me (C) so blue and

Neither of (E7) us ever had a clue

You thought you could (Dm) play me (Am)

You though you could (Fmaj7) play her too (F)

Bridge

Oh I (C) fell so hard

Don‚Äôt know what to (E7) do I just have my guitar

And I‚Äôm gonna (Dm) play it (Am)

Just like how you (Fmaj7) played my heart (G)

But I (C) miss your smile

It seemed oh so (E7) real for a while

Got my mind (Dm) twisting got me (Am) flipping

Thinking we‚Äôd (Fmaj7) walk down the aisle (F)

Verse

But it‚Äôs just (C) another day

I‚Äôm healing from (E7) heartbreak

I won‚Äôt shed (Dm) another tear (Am)

And all my (Fmaj7) emotions fading away (G)

If you find (C) another girl

I hope that you (E7) treat her well

Don‚Äôt tell her (Dm) you love her (Am)

Don‚Äôt trap her (Fmaj7) under your spell (F)
