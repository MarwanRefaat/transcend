üí° The contents below are not a part of the song above but rather exist as a guide outlining the general standards of a top 10 hit song.

These are ‚Äúsoft‚Äù constraints to guide creativity but virtually no top 10 song meets all of these entirely, data *can‚Äôt* replace creativity but maybe it can guide it.

# **SCRATCHPAD:**

The market crashing

You just can‚Äôt raise

Trying taking off

Running out of runway

I‚Äôm taking all 

These amphetamines

tRYING keep awake

Dreams go tos leep

I ask her if I got bad news I gotta quit what do we do

i ASK her hey

What should we dxo

We gotta take of running out of runways

It‚Äôs just rocket science

We‚Äôll take vertically

The way 

LSD

Ask if you got choices

I‚Äôve bad got

I‚Äôve got to tell you

It‚Äôs what to do

I ask her if you got 

If this is roc ket science, then take of vertically

---

There‚Äôs you gotta you gotta get a take

off 

IS

You pressed the bit too

Running out of cash

Running out of runway

You‚Äôre close to taking off

But you‚Äôre running out of runway

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

Made a bunch of wrong decisions you wish you could change today

You led people and looks like you lead them astray

We‚Äôre running out of runway what do 

Take vertically

Well it‚Äôs science

THen take overtically

---

So close to taking off

But you‚Äôre running out of runway

You thought you knew 

Led a bunch of peole astray

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

You‚Äôre close to taking off

But you‚Äôre running out of runway

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

**Chorus**

You‚Äôre close to taking off

But you‚Äôre running out of runway

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

If this is rocket science

Then this should be easy

Planeds might need runways

We take of vertically

I ask her what do you need

We‚Äôre running low on cash

What do you neewd

I don‚Äôt nedd a sallary I just need equity

This isn‚Äôt rocket science

But you don‚Äôt needf the runway

Cause the way 

It‚Äôs simple rocket science

We‚Äôll take of vertically
