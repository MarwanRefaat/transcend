# Lyrics

Could I change your mind
Alter what you see
Rewire your brain
To remove your anxiety

Could I change your mind
You say it’s always been that way
But it hurts to feel it’s something I can’t change

If I can’t change your mind
Can I numb the pain
Now we both can’t sleep
Cause your wide awake

I know you can’t control it
But maybe I could try
Take a deep breath with me
I promise you’ll be fine

Could I change your mind
Alter what you see
Rewire your brain
To remove your anxiety
