# **GUIDE:**

üí° The contents below are not a part of the song above but rather exist as a guide outlining the general standards of a top 10 hit song.

These are ‚Äúsoft‚Äù constraints to guide creativity but virtually no top 10 song meets all of these entirely, data *can‚Äôt* replace creativity but maybe it can guide it.

# **SCRATCHPAD:**

**Poem:**

When the floor drops below your feet

you can't know where you will land

in a field of daffodils

or shattered into sand

what they don't say is if you fall

all you need is a plan

to reassemble pieces

or make bouquets out of the land
