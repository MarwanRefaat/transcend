# **SCRATCHPAD:**

Oh little dreamer what do you see
Nightmares in your head aren‚Äôt easy to see

So tell me darling why do you cry
So I can find a way to show you it‚Äôll be alright

Dreamer what do you fear
I want to make the monsters in your all disappear

Plagues anxiety
And what do I do when sometimes you‚Äôre scared of me

So here‚Äôs the thing it‚Äôs not that there‚Äôs nothing to fear
But can you take some comfort knowing I‚Äôm here

Let me show you the demons in my head
And if they‚Äôre different than yours maybe ours could be friend
