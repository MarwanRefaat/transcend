# **GUIDE:**

<aside>
💡 The contents below are not a part of the song above but rather exist as a guide outlining the general standards of a top 10 hit song.

These are “soft” constraints to guide creativity but virtually no top 10 song meets all of these entirely, data *can’t* replace creativity but maybe it can guide it.

# **SCRATCHPAD:**

If I could spend one day inside your brain
I wonder what if find exploring that terrain
I know you’re hurting and I can feel your pain
But I can’t read your mind so please explain

What goes on in your head when your anxious when it’s safe
Is there something I can do cause it’
g

You’re so beautiful outside your brain and in mine it’s clear to see
So tell me how can it be so different from me

Tell me how it works oh the wonders of your mind
How can you wanna change so much and when I want you to mine

Oh the things you see can you put them into dall-E 2
Which you could use your words to make shapes inside my head rotate
