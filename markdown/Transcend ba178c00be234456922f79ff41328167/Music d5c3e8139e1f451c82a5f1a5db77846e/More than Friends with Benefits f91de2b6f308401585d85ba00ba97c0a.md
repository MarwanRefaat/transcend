# **GUIDE:**

üí° The contents below are not a part of the song above but rather exist as a guide outlining the general standards of a top 10 hit song.

These are ‚Äúsoft‚Äù constraints to guide creativity but virtually no top 10 song meets all of these entirely, data *can‚Äôt* replace creativity but maybe it can guide it.

# **SCRATCHPAD:**

Started as friends but now that‚Äôs in the past
We shifted gears and we‚Äôre moving fast

Flip the switch just let go
If we never try we‚Äôll never
Jeapordize our friendship it‚Äôs all we know
But what happen we come the other though

Chorus
I don‚Äôt quite remember it‚Äôs not switch I fell love and but I still remember the feeling then we kissed
I don‚Äôt quite know how or when when we crossed the line
But I can‚Äôt stop thinking about a world where you‚Äôre miners

We‚Äôve tried being friend and now you should try being mind

I get how you‚Äôre feeling your on the fence
And One side is our friendship could end
But tell me what do you on the other side
Cause if you feel how I feel how long do you plan to hide

Maybe we could more than just than just friends benefits

Now I‚Äôm thinking could it be more than this
Maybe we could be more than friends with benefits
