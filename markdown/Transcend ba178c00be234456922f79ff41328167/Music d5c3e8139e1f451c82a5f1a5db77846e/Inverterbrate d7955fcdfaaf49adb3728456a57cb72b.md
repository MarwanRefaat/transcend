# **SCRATCHPAD:**

I remember African girls at my school
Oh they could dance

The way she moves and wind up and either way
You question if she has a vertebrae
She said she does but I might need an x-ray

The way you move your body it‚Äôs like you don‚Äôt have a spine
You really know what you‚Äôre doing when you start to whine

You make me wonder why I ever left Egypt behind

Go to parties my friend Amechi on the beat

Dancing all night she‚Äôs energy
One of two good reasons why she shouldn‚Äôt go to sleep

There‚Äôs high potential to all of her energy

Nigerians girls they really love their STEM
But they must hate physics cause they make those laws bend

And if Nigerians are so good at science and at math
Why do they break the laws of physics every time they dance
I wanna see the potential of her kinetic energy
Newton said for every action there‚Äôs one equal opposite
So I‚Äôm not breaking the law when I start pushing against to your hips
F = M A and you know how to shake that wait pardon me
What I meant to say is I feel the forced of your accelerating mass
Once we‚Äôre in motion there‚Äôs no reason they should rest but to make certain we should put that to the test

Once we‚Äôre both dancing our bodies will not rest if you don‚Äôt believe me put his first law to

Let‚Äôs put Newton‚Äôs first law to the test
Once we start moving there‚Äôs no reason we should rest

Cause she really masters that kinetic energy
But enough of physics let‚Äôs start talking chemistry

Or better yet let‚Äôs talk anatomy

See I really don‚Äôt think you were born with a spine

There‚Äôs no way you‚Äôre not an invertebrate
The only way you could make your hips gyrate

And all their parents want them to go to medical school
Guess it makes sense she good at chemistry too

There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôre not invertebrate
That‚Äôs just not how human hips are able to rotate
