üí° The contents below are not a part of the song above but rather exist as a guide outlining the general standards of a top 10 hit song.

These are ‚Äúsoft‚Äù constraints to guide creativity but virtually no top 10 song meets all of these entirely, data *can‚Äôt* replace creativity but maybe it can guide it.

# LYRICS:

Capo 1

VERSE 

A (G) teaspoon of sweetness

A (Am7) few cups of bliss

A (D7) minced pound of handsome

(G) Mixed in with a kiss

A (G) big scoop of humor

(Am7) Intelligence too

(D7) This recipe makes for

(G) A serving of you

It (G) may not be perfect

But (Am7) with every try 

It‚Äôs (D7) better and better

Soon (G) measured by eye

And (G) on every page

Peeking (Am7) out right above 

You‚Äôll (D7) see that I‚Äôve bookmarked

The (G) things that I love

CHORUS 

Can you tell me 

What makes you good

A secret ingredient 

Tell me you should

It‚Äôs not in the 

Recipe alright

Cause no one else makes it

Just quite right

La la la

la la da di dum

la la la 

la la da di di 

La la la

la la da di dum

la la la 

la di da
