# **SCRATCHPAD:**

Ok here we go

Ask me where we‚Äôre going and I tgell you I don‚Äôt know

Hitting the gas pedal i don‚Äôt wanna slow

We take things fast I don‚Äôt how they‚Äôll go

Maybe they‚Äôll crash and burn

But if I they do I wanna be here for the show

Maybe we‚Äôre taking things way too fast

Maybe I should lay my foot of the gas 

Maybe these questions won‚Äôt be answered

But I wanna make sure that they are asked

Oh baby here we go

Wreckless mistakes

Wreckless driving in a wreckless race

But i‚ÄôLL KEEP DRIVING

AND SEE WHAT KINDA OF WRECK WE‚ÄôLL MAKE

(Escape

Wrecked pasts

all the times from the times drove fast

But a girl live you one

I just couldn‚Äôt drive past

Every single person that ever made it to first place

Is only there cause they also risked ending up last

Wrecked past I‚Äôve always had a pecnhant for driving things a bit too hard

and a little fast

Mistakes wreckless driving wreckeless 

Hit the gas 

Wreckless driving wreckless mistakes

Can‚Äôt take my foot off the gas even when I know I ripped off the brakes

And then I wait for myself to make a mistakes

The pain of wreckless driving when you‚Äôre sane

I just wan

And I might brick wall and stay stepping on the gas

Insane wreckless driving seeking pain

Can‚Äôt take my foot off the gas even when I know I ripped off the brakes

I wait till I‚Äôm going too fast so I can‚Äôt let myself make a single mistake

Driving 

Push it to the edge and till there‚Äôs no gas left

Now there‚Äôs gas left, runs

Wrecless mistakes, and wreckless past

And if I keep going this way I might just be another wreck you drive past
