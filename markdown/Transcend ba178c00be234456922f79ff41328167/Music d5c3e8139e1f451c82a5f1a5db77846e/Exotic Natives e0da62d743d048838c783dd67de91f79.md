# **GUIDE:**

üí° The contents below are not a part of the song above but rather exist as a guide outlining the general standards of a top 10 hit song.

These are ‚Äúsoft‚Äù constraints to guide creativity but virtually no top 10 song meets all of these entirely, data *can‚Äôt* replace creativity but maybe it can guide it.

# **SCRATCHPAD:**

I don‚Äôt know where you‚Äôre from but you‚Äôre hella fine

California girl

Every girl here is exotic to me and guess it‚Äôs cause I‚Äôm foreign

And if she‚Äôs not native I guess she‚Äôs double foreign

Posting Starbucks on the gram
And they call her basic
I‚Äôm liking what I see like I got some lasik

If her parents immigrants cause it makes her double foreign

Maybe she‚Äôs basic but does she another

Eating hummus pita chips looks like she could use Mediterranean spice

I can‚Äôt leave this place for now cause I‚Äôm undocumented
But one day I‚Äôll show you the world like im Aladdin

She‚Äôs tell me her parents aren‚Äôt from here
I‚Äôm like damn she‚Äôs double foreign
