# **GUIDE:**

<aside>
üí° The contents below are not a part of the song above but rather exist as a guide outlining the general standards of a top 10 hit song.

These are ‚Äúsoft‚Äù constraints to guide creativity but virtually no top 10 song meets all of these entirely, data *can‚Äôt* replace creativity but maybe it can guide it.

# **SCRATCHPAD:**

I don‚Äôt think I could ever be sane
Two revolutions 12 years of age

Old enough to know going on
But young to know what's wrong

Chorus

I have these GIFs in my head

and they‚Äôre looping on repeat

I wish I could purge my brain

But I can‚Äôt find the delete

It‚Äôs just like a tik tok trend

A certain sound can make you move

Just like the memes that you share

You start to see them everywhere
