When Marwan was 14 he directed the Musical into the Woods at an all-boys summer camp (cross-dressing and all). It was incredibly impactful on an emotional level for a lot of us and a really powerful bonding experience and years later there seems to have been some professional ROI given the guy who was most opposed to joining it (former quarterback) recently won a daytime Emmy award (Nicholas Alexander Chavez) and remains Marwan’s closest friend from that camp. A claim this grand needs to come with some due diligence so here’s a data room:

Shared art is a meaningful direction and tech can unlock another few orders of magnitude.

### Who are your competitors? What do you understand about your business that they don't?

Artists want to perform and need to get paid. Live performance is the highest fidelity fullfilment of what people “want” but there needs to be a way to scale it financially and manage the logistical side of things which is where software must come in.

### How do or will you make money? How much could you make?

(We realize you can't know precisely, but give your best estimate.)

Live performances (”do things that don’t scale” type thing) just to bootstrap some liquidity of artists x engineers and build some momentum and then all those performances will be published on a Transcend spotify/apple music etc. and over time as momentum builds hopefully majority of revenue will come from streaming. The holy grail would be if we can capture enough mindshare to be the distribution platform and potentially some form of membership/subscription revenue for ad-hoc live performances. In other words, we don’t know how we’re going to make money yet?
