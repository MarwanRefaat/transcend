# Lyrics

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ Note that the version above were just improvised scratch vocals the lyrics below are the ones that weâ€™ll re-record with

</aside>

See itâ€™s getting pretty late

So tell me what you wanna do?

You could come back to my place

Well honestly itâ€™s just a room

You texted me said you were bored

Well I know just what we could do

Cause You see my room has a door

And the lock works too

And with the mattress on the floor

The neighbors wonâ€™t hear you / The only sound weâ€™ll hear is you
