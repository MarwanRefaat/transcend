</aside>

See it’s getting pretty late

So tell me what you wanna do?

You could come back to my place

Well honestly it’s just a room

You texted me said you were bored

Well I know just what we could do

Cause you see my room has a door

And the lock works too

I’ll give you a tour of my room

All 80 square feet

The main attraction is a pile of dirty clothes

And our attraction might make one with some sheets

Yeah I know I should clean my room

A pile of laundry on the right

But I’ll push it off to tomorrow

Cause I know there will be more if you stay the night

Keep my mattress on the floor

Flag on the wall too that says

Saturdays for the boys

But I’ll make an exception for you

A pile of laundry on the floor

Stay the night and I’ll have some more

And with the mattress on the floor

So all the neighbors hear is you

I know I might get evicted if I get one more noise complaint

But California law’s on our side so you’ve got a place to stay

You ask

Why there a bed in you living room

Cause my boy needs some living room

And why does your fridge smell like that?

It’s been three months since I first asked

I’lll give you a tour of my room

All 50 square feet

First things the mattress on the floor
