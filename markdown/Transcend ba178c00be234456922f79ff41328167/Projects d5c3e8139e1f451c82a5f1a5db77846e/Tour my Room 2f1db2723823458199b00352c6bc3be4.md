</aside>

See itâ€™s getting pretty late

So tell me what you wanna do?

You could come back to my place

Well honestly itâ€™s just a room

You texted me said you were bored

Well I know just what we could do

Cause You see my room has a door

And the lock works too

And with the mattress on the floor

So all the neighbors hear is you

Yeah I know I should clean my room

A pile of laundry on the right

But Iâ€™ll push it off to tomorrow

Cause I know there will be more if you stay the night

Keep my mattress on the floor

Flag on the wall too that says

Saturdays for the boys

But Iâ€™ll make an exception for you

A pile of laundry on the floor

Stay the night and Iâ€™ll have some more

I know I might get evicted if I get one more noise complaint

But California lawâ€™s on our side so youâ€™ve got a place to stay

Thereâ€™s a bed in my living room

Cause my boy needs some living room

So why does the fridge smell like that

Itâ€™s been three months see I first asked

Iâ€™ll give you a tour of my room

All 50 square feet

Y pile of dirty clothes

Alright letâ€™s make one with some sheets

Iâ€™lll give you a tour of my room

All 50 square feet

First things the mattress on the floor
