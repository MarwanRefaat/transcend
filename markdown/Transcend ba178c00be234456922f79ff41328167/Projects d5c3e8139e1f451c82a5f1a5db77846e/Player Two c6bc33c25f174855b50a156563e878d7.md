# **GUIDE:**

üí° The contents below are not a part of the song above but rather exist as a guide outlining the general standards of a top 10 hit song.

These are ‚Äúsoft‚Äù constraints to guide creativity but virtually no top 10 song meets all of these entirely, data *can‚Äôt* replace creativity but maybe it can guide it.

# **SCRATCHPAD:**

She is player one and he is player two

He‚Äôs is a player and she plays with people too

His heart is racing like it‚Äôs playing mario kart

And her heart lost last time around but she keeps on hitting restart

Both of them trying to find a way to go to the next level

Are you ready to just press start
Since you‚Äôre playing games make me player two

I want to get to the next level with you

All we gotta do is just press start

We‚Äôve been playing games looking for player two
Now I‚Äôm wondering if that could be you

All you gotta do is just press start

You‚Äôve been playing games and I‚Äôm a player too
But what I really want is for you to be player two

Got my heart is racing like it‚Äôs playing mario kart

These games you play they hurt me but I press restart

I‚Äôm out here trying to take things to next level

Now I‚Äôm addicted and can‚Äôt stop dancing with the devil

Ideas:
Something about ‚Äúpause‚Äù

Something about keeping ‚Äúscore‚Äù

Something about ‚Äúunlock‚Äù

Something about playing on the same side
