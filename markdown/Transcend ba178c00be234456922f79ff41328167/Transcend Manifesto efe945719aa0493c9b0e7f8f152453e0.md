# Overview

Imagine open-source academy award winning productions…

The box office, triple-platinums, and masterpieces of the future will be built by an open-source hive mind. It will be bidirectional, iterative, generative, evolutionary and transcendent.

The worlds most impactful software products are built collaboratively by engineers making ad-hoc contributions to massive shared projects. This was made possible largely thanks to version control systems and tooling enabling these systems (e.g. [GitHub](https://github.com/), GitLab, BitBucket, etc.) which have become the ubiquitous industry standard.

Engineering has accelerated tremendously as as result of Git, what might happen if we applied the same principles to the performing arts world?

## How this Started

There’s a surprising amount of musical talent in Silicon Valley and we’ve been hosting frequent [jam sessions](../Transcend%20ba178c00be234456922f79ff41328167.md). We often improvise songs and when we wanted to memorialize them somewhere and start sharing them with our friends we created a GitHub repository so that we could view the progress of our music and the evolution of each song from inception to completion. This is when we realized that a version control system could offer a lot more than just revision history, we could start to collaborate, remix, and recompose what we’ve made in an ad-hoc manner.

## The Roadblock

GitHub simply isn’t built for musical collaboration and our strategy of using ReadMe files to share our work started to become more and more brittle, simple functionality like playing an mp3 directly from the page or uploading a file over 10mb quickly made the process of collaborating smoothly highly inefficient.

## The Minimum Viable Product

Knowing that Notion is based and fully interoperable with Markdown (the same language used for GitHub’s README files) we decided to sync a Notion workspace to GitHub such that we had the best of both world, an easy to use interface to collaborate and manage our musical project alongside the benefits of a version control system.

# The (Imagined) Product

For now we’re bootstrapping a rough version of the product by combining the [Notion API](https://developers.notion.com/) with GitHub but we ultimately hope to build a GitHub for music.

## Collaborative Music Creation

- Contribute to projects quickly with automatic environment setup.
- Make sure you see the changes you care about.
- Build community around your code
