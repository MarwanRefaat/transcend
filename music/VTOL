The market crashing

You just can’t raise

Trying taking off

Running out of runway

I’m taking all 

These amphetamines

tRYING keep awake

Dreams go tos leep

I ask her if I got bad news I gotta quit what do we do

i ASK her hey

What should we dxo

We gotta take of running out of runways

It’s just rocket science

We’ll take vertically

The way 

LSD

Ask if you got choices

I’ve bad got

I’ve got to tell you

It’s what to do

I ask her if you got 

If this is roc ket science, then take of vertically

---

There’s you gotta you gotta get a take

off 

IS

You pressed the bit too

Running out of cash

Running out of runway

You’re close to taking off

But you’re running out of runway

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

Made a bunch of wrong decisions you wish you could change today

You led people and looks like you lead them astray

We’re running out of runway what do 

Take vertically

Well it’s science

THen take overtically

---

So close to taking off

But you’re running out of runway

You thought you knew 

Led a bunch of peole astray

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

You’re close to taking off

But you’re running out of runway

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

**Chorus**

You’re close to taking off

But you’re running out of runway

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

Blew a bunch of cash 

Led a bunch of peole astray

If this is rocket science

Then this should be easy

Planeds might need runways

We take of vertically

I ask her what do you need

We’re running low on cash

What do you neewd

I don’t nedd a sallary I just need equity

This isn’t rocket science

But you don’t needf the runway

Cause the way 

It’s simple rocket science

We’ll take of vertically
