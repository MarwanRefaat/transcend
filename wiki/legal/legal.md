# Legal

## Overview

The purpose of this folder is to include all legal documents in markdown form as well as the final executed documents as a PDF, the reasoning for the markdown is to allow for clean, transparent, traceable revision history of the legal documents in a manner that is time-stamped and by nature of Git largely automatically red-lined.

### Key Caveat

This level of transparency is experimental and it's very likely it won't be possible to sustain this as things scale with all legal documents however a general effort towards transparency will be made such that a significant portion is made available to those who need permisionless access. If a a document does truly need to made private a brief explanation will be provided in the spirit of accountability. In most cases however private/sensitive information (e.g. personally identifiable information, banking information, compensation etc. will simply be redacted).
